# Variable Names
- name cannot start with digit
- may include dollar signs and underscores but nothing else
- may want to use camelCase
- no keywords

# String Stuff
- \n
- \t "tab"

# Binary vs. Unary
- number of operands is different
- typeof
	- object references
- template literals
- write using "" double quotes, '' single quotes, and `` back ticks
	- special thing is can use template literals in back ticks

# Comparison Operators
- console.log(5 > 2);
- >=
- <=
- !==
- == vs ===
	- used when you do not want type conversion
- strings are ordered roughly alphabetic
	- lowercase is higher than upper case
	- compares each letter one by one
	- insert some practice

# Type Coercion
- when comparing two things of different type, Javascript does complicated things
- NaN (not a number)
- testing for null or undefined
	- returns true only if both sides are null or defined
	- useful to see if it variable holds value or not

# Ternary Operator
- think of it like a question

# Logical Operators
- &&, ||, !
- insert some practice

# Short Circuit Evaluation
- in ||, if the first is true, the second won't even be evaluated
- in &&, if the first one is false, the second won't even be evaluated
- fallback to default value
	- "console.log(null | "Hello")"
	- if something is null it will be coerced into false then prints "Hello"
	- 0, NaN, and empty string "" evaluates to false

# Expressions
- evaluates to particular value

# Modular Programming
- writing programs in chunks that are reusable
- keeps the code DRY ("Don't repeat yourself")

# Functions
- blocks of code that will execute and can return a value
- invoking a function
- parameters vs. arguments
- console.log is a function

# Conditional Execution
- if else (put a conditional)

# Loops
- for loop
- while loop
- do while
- indenting code
- updating values with shortcuts
	- +=
	- -=
	- ++
	- --
- break out of loop
	- use break

# Talk about Case Later

# Practice
- create triangle with loops
- create max min algorithm
